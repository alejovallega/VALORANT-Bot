# VALORANT-Bot
A VALORANT (free to play game online) bot trained using a neural network. Training done using tensorflow's object detection API using their Faster R-CNN Inception model.

An AI VALORANT player ran on a trained RCNN using tensorflow's object detection API. 
Training done using their saved training model "faster_rcnn_inception_resnet". Screen grabbing
and implementation done using their given scripts. Movement done in game was written using pyautogui

Notes:

- Average fps isn't the best, perhaps around 15-20. Could be improved by 
 optimizing multi-processing.

- Movement and trigger detection can be also improved in the future.
